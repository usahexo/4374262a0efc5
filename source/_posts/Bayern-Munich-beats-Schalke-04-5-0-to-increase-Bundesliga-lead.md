#  Bayern Munich beats Schalke 04 5-0 to increase Bundesliga lead

Bayern Munich beat Schalke 04 5-0 to keep up their fantastic form in the Bundesliga. The match was very one sided, with Bayern constantly attacking and Schalke struggling to create chances. Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring in the 9th minute, chipping the ball over the goalkeeper after a great through ball from Thiago Alcantara. Bayern then doubled their lead in the 20th minute, when David Alaba’s shot from outside the penalty area took a lucky deflection off Naldo and went into the net.

Schalke did have a few chances early on in the second half, but they were mostly ineffective. In the 67th minute, Arturo Vidal made it 3-0 with a powerful header after a cross from Kingsley Coman. Coman himself then got on the scoresheet in the 73rd minute, making it 4-0 with a well placed shot into the bottom corner. The final goal of the game came in the 85th minute, when Franck Ribery chipped the ball over Schalke’s goalkeeper to make it 5-0.

This result means that Bayern now have an 11point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table, and they look very likely to win their 6th consecutive league title.

#  James Rodriguez scores hat trick in Bayern Munich rout

Gerd Muller, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, and Thomas Muller. Just some of the great Bayern Munich players to have worn the number eleven shirt.

Bayern Munich took on Wolfsburg on Saturday, and James Rodriguez made history by becoming the fourth player to score a hat trick in a game for Bayern while wearing the number eleven shirt.

Rodriguez has been in good form for Bayern of late, scoring four goals in his last three appearances. His first goal against Wolfsburg came from the penalty spot, after he was brought down in the area by Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels.

The second goal came five minutes before halftime, as Rodriguez ran onto a ball played over the top of the Wolfsburg defense and finished clinically past Casteels. The third goal was perhaps the best of the lot, as Rodriguez controlled a pass on his chest before hitting an unstoppable volley into the top corner of the net.

It was an impressive performance from Rodriguez and Bayern Munich, and it puts them back on track after a poor run of results earlier this season.

#  Bayern Munich extends unbeaten streak in Bundesliga with 7th win

Bayern Munich continued their unbeaten streak in the Bundesliga on Saturday with a seventh consecutive win, beating Hoffenheim 3-1.

The defending champions are at the top of the table with 28 points, four ahead of second-place Borussia Dortmund, who lost at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.

Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring for Bayern in the 25th minute with a header from Thiago Alcantara’s cross. Serge Gnabry made it 2-0 in the 49th minute with a shot inside the far post after a through ball from Thomas Mueller.

Hoffenheim got one back in the 74th minute through Mark Uth, but Bayern restored their two-goal lead two minutes later when Joshua Kimmich scored from close range.

“We wanted to win and we played very well in the first half, dominated and created chances,” Bayern coach Niko Kovac said. “We were not so good in the second half but still created chances and deserved to win. We have won all our games this year apart from (a draw against) Gladbach and we are happy with that.”

#  Robert Lewandowski scores again as Bayern Munich beats Hoffenheim

Robert Lewandowski is in the form of his life. The Polish striker once again proved his worth to Bayern Munich, scoring the opener in their 3-1 win over Hoffenheim on Saturday.

It was an important victory for the Bundesliga champions, who bounced back from their shock defeat to Wolfsburg last weekend. And Lewandowski was central to it, taking his tally for the season to 18 goals in all competitions.

"He's in top form at the moment and is one of the most dangerous players in the world," said Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti after the game. "We're very happy with him."

Lewandowski has been on fire since joining Bayern from Borussia Dortmund in 2014 and he looks poised to break even more records this season. He is already the top scorer in Bundesliga history after overtaking Claudio Pizarro's record of 181 goals last month.

Now he is just three goals short of Gerd Muller's record haul of 67 goals in a single season for Bayern. With plenty of games still to play, there is every chance that Lewandowski will surpass that mark before the end of the campaign.

#  David Alaba scores as Bayern Munich beats RB Leipzig 2-1

David Alaba's goal early in the second half was enough to give Bayern Munich a 2-1 victory over RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga.

Kingsley Coman had put Bayern ahead in the first half, but a Marcel Sabitzer equalizer just after halftime kept Leipzig in the game.

Alaba then scored his third league goal of the season, firing home from close range in the 52nd minute.

The result moves Bayern six points clear of second-place Leipzig, and extends the Bavarians' unbeaten league run to 34 games.
