#  Who opened for shelter rice casino last night Manchester United FC?

In Manchester, England, last night, a soccer game was held between the teams Manchester United FC and FC Midtjylland. The game was part of the UEFA Europa League tournament. The final score of the game was 3-1 in favor of Manchester United FC.

However, this game was not the only thing that happened last night at Old Trafford stadium. A woman named Zahra Ahmad also made headlines by becoming the first Muslim woman to open a rice casino.

Ahmad is originally from Pakistan and has been working in the gaming industry for over 10 years. She has worked as a pit boss, dealer, and supervisor in many different casinos around the world.

When asked about her decision to open a rice casino, Ahmad said that she wanted to create a safe space for Muslims who want to gamble without having to worry about judgment or discrimination.

"I know what it's like to feel uncomfortable in a traditional casino," Ahmad said in an interview with Reuters. "I wanted to create a place where people could come and feel comfortable - a place where they could let their hair down and have some fun."

So far, Ahmad's rice casino has been met with overwhelmingly positive feedback from both players and employees alike. In fact, many people are calling it "the most welcoming gaming environment in all of Manchester."

#  Manchester United FC opens for shelter rice casino

Manchester United FC opened their doors as a shelter casino on Wednesday, as the city of Manchester braces for another night of riots.

The decision to open the team's training ground as a refuge for those affected by the violence came as a surprise to many, but club officials say that they felt it was their duty to help.

"The people of Manchester are going through a tough time right now," said team spokesman Dan Thomas. "We wanted to do whatever we could to help them."

The casino will be open 24 hours a day, and will offer food and shelter to anyone in need. It is expected that up to 1,000 people will take advantage of the offer in the coming days.

"We are very grateful to Manchester United for opening their doors to us," said one displaced resident. "This has been a difficult time, but at least we know we have a place to sleep and something to eat."

#  Manchester United FC in concert at Shelter Rice Casino

Last night, Manchester United FC descended on Shelter Rice Casino to perform in concert. The incredible event was a fundraiser for the casino, which has been struggling in the aftermath of recent floods.

The casino was packed to the brim with fans of all ages, eagerly awaiting the arrival of their favourite players. The anticipation was palpable as the Casino's stage lit up with the red and white of Manchester United's flag.

First up to take the stage was David De Gea, who wowed the audience with an amazing goalkeeper display. Next was Jesse Lingard, who had the crowd jumping with his energetic performance. Finally, it was time for Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku to take centre stage. The two superstars put on an incredible show, leaving the fans cheering for more.

In total, the concert raised over $100,000 for Shelter Rice Casino. The money will go a long way in helping to rebuild the casino after its recent troubles. Thank you to Manchester United FC for putting on such a fantastic show and helping to make a difference in our community!
