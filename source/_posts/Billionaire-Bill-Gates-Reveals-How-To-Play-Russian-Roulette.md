#  How To Play Russian Roulette The Gates Way

In Russian roulette, the player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against their head, and pulls the trigger. If the player survives, they win; if they die, they lose.

With Russian Roulette you can eliminate some of the risk by playing with more than one round in the revolver. With this game you can also increase your chances of winning by using a revolver with more chambers. With 3 rounds in the chamber, there is a 2/3 chance that you will survive.

To play Russian roulette with three rounds:

1. Place three rounds in a revolver.
2. Spin the cylinder to randomize the position of the rounds.
3. Point the revolver at your head and pull the trigger once. 
4. If you live, repeat steps 2-3 two more times. 
5 If you die, you lose!
