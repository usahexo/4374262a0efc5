#  Gambling industry booming in Atlanta

Atlanta has always been a city with a gambling culture. From the racetracks in the suburbs to the casinos downtown, there has always been a way for people in Atlanta to gamble. And with the legalization of gambling on casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and poker, the gambling industry has seen a massive boom in recent years.

Casinos have sprung up all over the city, and more are planned. The Rivers Casino is a $675 million complex that recently opened in suburban Austell. It features 6,900 slot machines and electronic table games, and it is already one of the most successful casinos in the state. A $2 billion casino resort is planned for Atlanta’s Gulch district, and other casinos are being considered in College Park, Stone Mountain, and Hapeville.

The gambling industry is providing much-needed jobs and tax revenue for Atlanta. The Rivers Casino employs 1,800 people, and its construction generated 3,000 jobs. The casino pays $14 million in annual taxes to local governments. The new casino resort is expected to create 6,000 permanent jobs and generate $475 million in annual revenue. Gambling revenues are also helping to fund education and infrastructure projects throughout the city.

While some people worry that legalized gambling will lead to addiction and social ills, the reality is that the gambling industry is providing much-needed jobs and revenue for Atlanta. With so many casinos springing up all over the city, there’s something for everyone who wants to gamble in Atlanta.

#  Gambling growing more popular in Atlanta

### Atlanta has always been a city with a gambling culture. Gambling has been popular among many Atlantans for years, but the activity has been growing more and more popular in recent years.

There are several reasons for this. For one thing, there are now more places to gamble in Atlanta than ever before. Casinos and racetracks have been popping up all over the metro area in recent years, and this has made gambling more accessible to more people.

 Additionally, the economy has been doing fairly well in recent years, and this has led many people to turn to gambling as a way to make some extra money. And finally, there is also the thrill of gambling that seems to be drawing people in. Gambling can be an exciting activity, and it can be fun to try to win big money by betting on games or races.

All of these factors have contributed to the growth of gambling in Atlanta in recent years. And while there are certainly some risks associated with gambling, it looks like this activity is going to continue to be popular among Atlantans for years to come.

#  Atlantic City gambling revenue drops, Atlanta unaffected

Atlantic City, the gambling hub of the east coast, has seen its gambling revenue drop significantly in recent years. In 2015, the city took in $2.56 billion in gambling revenue. That number dropped to $2.06 billion in 2016 and was on track to fall even further in 2017. This decline is having a significant impact on the city's economy, with jobs and tax revenue disappearing along with the money flowing into the casinos.

Atlanta, however, has not seen a similar decline in gambling revenue. The city took in $2.58 billion in gambling revenue in 2015, $2.68 billion in 2016, and is on track to take in over $2.8 billion this year. This is despite the legalization of gambling in Georgia a few years ago.

So what is different about Atlantic City and Atlanta? There are a few factors that play into this difference.

First, Atlantic City is much closer to New York City than Atlanta is to any major city. This means that there is more competition for gamblers in Atlantic City than there is in Atlanta. New York City residents can easily drive to Atlantic City for a day of gambling, while those living in other parts of the country have to fly or drive much further to get to Atlanta.

Second, Atlantic City has more casinos than Atlanta does. This means that there is more competition for gamblers in Atlantic City, which drives down the amount of money each casino takes in. Atlanta also has multiple casinos, but they are not as close together as they are in Atlantic City, so there is less competition for customers there.

Third, Atlantic City has had legal gambling longer than Atlanta has. Gambling was legalized in New Jersey in 1976, while it was only legalized in Georgia a few years ago. This means that there are more people used to gambling in Atlantic City than there are in Atlanta, and that those people are spending less money at the casinos.

Finally, Atlantic City has been struggling economically for years before the decline in gambling revenue started happening. This means that people have less money to spend on casino games than they did a few years ago. The same cannot be said for Atlanta, which is still seeing strong economic growth despite the legalization of gambling.

#  Gambling expanding in popularity throughout the south

Gambling is growing in popularity throughout the south, as more and more states legalize various forms of the activity. Louisiana was one of the latest states to do so, with a bill legalizing fantasy sports taking effect in August.

The legalization of gambling in Louisiana and other states has led to an expansion of the gambling industry, as businesses seek to capitalize on the new market. This has included an increase in advertising for gambling activities, as well as an expansion of gambling options available to consumers.

The growth of gambling in the south is not without its opponents, however. Some religious organizations and law enforcement officials have expressed concerns about the social impacts of increased gambling. They argue that it can lead to addiction and financial devastation for those who participate in it.

Despite these concerns, the growth of gambling appears likely to continue in the south. States are increasingly aware of the potential revenue streams that legalized gambling can generate, and are eager to take advantage of them.

#  Georgia considers expanding gambling

The state of Georgia is considering the expansion of gambling in order to generate more revenue. This proposal has generated a great deal of controversy, with opponents stating that it will lead to increased crime and addiction rates. Proponents argue that the additional revenue will be used to fund education and other vital services.

Currently, Georgia has a limited number of gambling options, including horse racing, lottery, and charitable games. The proposed expansion would include new casinos, as well as sports betting and internet gambling.

 Supporters of the measure argue that it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state. They point to examples such as New Jersey, which has seen a significant increase in revenue since legalizing sports betting. Opponents are concerned about the potential social costs of expanding gambling, including addiction and crime.

So far, the proposal has not passed the legislature, but it is expected to be debated again in the coming months.
