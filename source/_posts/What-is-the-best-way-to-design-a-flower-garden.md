When choosing plants, be sure to consider the amount of sunlight they need and how much water they require. Also, take into account the color and texture of the leaves and flowers.

Once you have chosen your plants, it is time to start arranging them in your garden. Begin by drawing a plan of your garden on paper. This will help you to visualize how everything will look when it is planted.

When planting, be sure to follow the directions on the plant tag regarding spacing between plants. Overcrowding can lead to poor air circulation and may cause disease problems.
