#  Who Can Deal The Most Poker Hands? Ronaldo Or Messi?

In the game of poker, the best hand is the one with the highest card. The ace is high, and the two is low. When two or more players have the same high card, then the next highest card (or cards) determine the winner. So, for example, if two players have an ace, and both also have a king, then the player with the higher second card (a queen in this case) would be the winner. 

Some people might think that Ronaldo is better at poker than Messi because he is a great goal scorer. However, when it comes to dealing hands, Messi may have the edge over Ronaldo. This is because Messi has been known to bluff his opponents on occasion. In fact, some people regard him as one of the best bluffers in all of football.

Ronaldo has been known to be quite a conservative player when it comes to poker. He tends to stick with good hands and does not take too many risks. As a result, he may not be able to win as many hands as Messi.

There is no definitive answer as to who is better at poker â€“ Ronaldo or Messi. It really depends on the situation and how each player chooses to play their cards.
