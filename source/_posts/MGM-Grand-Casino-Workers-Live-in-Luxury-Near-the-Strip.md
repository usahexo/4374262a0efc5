#  Casino Workers in Henderson Struggle to Make Ends Meet

Casino workers in Henderson are struggling to make ends meet as their wages have not kept up with the cost of living. Many have reported that they are having to work multiple jobs in order to support their families, and some have even had to move away from Henderson due to the high cost of housing.

The casino workers are asking for a raise of $2 per hour, which would help them to afford basic necessities like food and housing. They argue that their jobs are vital to the casino's operation and that they should be compensated accordingly.

Meanwhile, the casino has argued that it cannot afford to give the workers a raise, citing falling profits and increasing costs. It has offered a small raise of 50 cents per hour, which the workers have rejected.

The standoff between the casino workers and management shows no sign of ending anytime soon. The workers are determined to get a fair wage, while the casino is unwilling to budge on its offer. This conflict is likely to continue to cause tension in Henderson's labour market.

#  Most Casino Workers in Las Vegas Prefer to Live Near the Strip

A survey of casino workers in Las Vegas has found that the majority prefer to live near the Strip. The results come as no surprise to many locals, who are well-aware of the hectic lifestyle and long hours associated with working in the casino industry.

A recent article in the Las Vegas Review-Journal explored the preference among casino employees to live near the Strip. According to the survey, conducted by Review-Journal columnist John L. Smith, 73 percent of casino workers would rather live within walking distance of their place of employment than anywhere else in Las Vegas.

In addition, almost half (47 percent) of respondents said they would move out of Las Vegas altogether if they could not live near the Strip.

The findings are understandable when considering the demanding nature of casino work. Many employees work long hours and weekends, often dealing with difficult customers and managing stress levels that can be high. For those living on or close to the Strip, getting home for a quick dinner or a good night’s sleep is much easier than for those who have to travel further away.

The trend is particularly pronounced among millennials, a majority of whom (74 percent) said they would rather live near the Strip than anywhere else in Las Vegas. This is likely due, at least in part, to the fact that millennials are more likely than other generations to prefer walkable neighborhoods and city living.

While it is not surprising that casino workers prefer to live near the Strip, it is interesting to see how starkly this preference divides them from other residents of Las Vegas. For example, according to a 2017 study by Apartment List, only 34 percent of all Las Vegas residents would rather live near their job than anywhere else in the city.

This discrepancy may be due, in part, to the fact that casino jobs are not necessarily seen as desirable positions by many people outside of the industry. In contrast, those who work in casinos often see it as a career opportunity with good earning potential and plenty of room for advancement.

#  Living Near the Las Vegas Strip is a Priority for Most Casino Employees

So if you’re looking for a place to live near the Las Vegas Strip, you’ll have no trouble finding a great option. There are literally hundreds of apartments and condos within walking distance of the Strip. And because prices are so high in Las Vegas, most of these places are quite affordable.
