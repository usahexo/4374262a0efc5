#  How to play King of Dwarves?

King of Dwarves is a fantastic strategy game with an interesting premise - you have to lead your dwarves to glory, reclaiming mines and facing off against hordes of goblins, all the while making sure your people are happy and healthy. Here's our guide on how to get started playing the game!

## The Basics

The first thing you'll need to do is create a new game. You can do this by clicking on the New Game button in the main menu. This will bring up a popup where you can choose your game settings. There are a few things you'll need to decide on here:

- Your play style: Casual or Advanced? Casual games are more forgiving and have simpler rules, while Advanced games are more challenging and involve more strategic decision making.

- The map: This determines the layout of the world and the difficulty of the game. There are six different maps to choose from, each with its own unique challenges.

- The Population cap: This sets the maximum number of dwarves you can have in your kingdom.

- The Difficulty: This controls how hard the AI is set to play. There are four levels of difficulty to choose from.

Once you've chosen your settings, click Create Game and you'll be taken to the main game screen. Here, you'll see your dwarves' settlement at the bottom of the screen, and an overview of the surrounding area above it. Your objective is to guide your dwarves to victory by reclaiming mines, defeating goblins, and keeping your people happy and healthy. Let's take a closer look at each of these aspects of the game!

### Reclaiming Mines

Mines are important in King of Dwarves - they're where you get your resources from! To reclaim a mine, simply move one of your dwarves onto it. Once they're there, they'll start working on reclaiming it for your kingdom. The more mines you have, the more resources you'll get each turn, so it's important to try and claim as many mines as possible. However, be careful - if another player conquers one of your mines, they'll take control of it and you won't be able to reclaim it until you defeat them or they abandon it.
