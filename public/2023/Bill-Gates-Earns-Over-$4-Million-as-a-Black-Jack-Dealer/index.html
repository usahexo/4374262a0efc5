	  <h1 id="Bill-Gates-Earns-Over-4-Million-as-a-Black-Jack-Dealer"><a href="#Bill-Gates-Earns-Over-4-Million-as-a-Black-Jack-Dealer" class="headerlink" title="Bill Gates Earns Over $4 Million as a Black Jack Dealer"></a>Bill Gates Earns Over $4 Million as a Black Jack Dealer</h1><p>Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, surprised many when he revealed that he is a blackjack dealer in a Las Vegas casino. Gates stated in an interview that he enjoys the challenge of dealing blackjack and earning a six-figure salary doing so.</p>
<p>According to reports, Gates earns over $4 million each year from his blackjack dealing duties. In addition to this, Gates also earns money through his investment portfolio and various other business ventures.</p>
<p>Despite his wealth, Gates remains humble and down-to-earth. He often donates millions of dollars to charity and has pledged to donate at least half of his wealth to charitable causes.</p>
<h1 id="Gates-is-the-Highest-Paid-Dealer-in-Atlantic-Town"><a href="#Gates-is-the-Highest-Paid-Dealer-in-Atlantic-Town" class="headerlink" title="Gates is the Highest-Paid Dealer in Atlantic Town"></a>Gates is the Highest-Paid Dealer in Atlantic Town</h1><p>Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, is also the highest-paid dealer in Atlantic Town.</p>
<p>Gates moved to Atlantic Town in 2014 and purchased a casino. The casino was not doing well, but Gates turned it around and made it into one of the most profitable in the city.</p>
<p>Gates is known for being a ruthless businessman. He is not afraid to make tough decisions and he always puts his casino first.</p>
<p>Atlantic Town is a great place to live and work. The weather is perfect year-round and there are plenty of things to do. Gates loves the city and he plans to stay here for a long time.</p>
<h1 id="Gates-Makes-More-Than-Most-Casino-Employees"><a href="#Gates-Makes-More-Than-Most-Casino-Employees" class="headerlink" title="Gates Makes More Than Most Casino Employees"></a>Gates Makes More Than Most Casino Employees</h1><p>Forbes released their annual list of the 400 richest Americans and for the first time in history, Bill Gates was not at the top. Gates has been knocked down to second place behind Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. But even though Gates’ net worth has decreased by $4.2 billion in the past year, he is still doing very well for himself with a fortune of $90 billion.</p>
<p>What’s even more impressive than Gates’ net worth is how he got there. Unlike other billionaires on the list who made their money through investments or inheritance, Gates built his empire from scratch. Microsoft, which he founded in 1975, is now one of the largest tech companies in the world.</p>
<p>But what’s even more interesting than Gates’ wealth is how he spends it. Despite being one of the richest people in the world, Gates doesn’t live a lavish lifestyle. In fact, he and his wife Melinda only spend about $10 million per year. That might sound like a lot, but it’s actually pretty modest compared to other billionaires.</p>
<p>In contrast, Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife spend about $200 million per year. And that doesn’t include their $30 million home or their fleet of luxury cars. But even though Adelson has a much bigger budget than Gates, he can’t compare when it comes to philanthropy.</p>
<p>Gates and his wife have donated over $40 billion to charity over the years, making them some of the most generous people on the planet. They’ve also started their own foundation which focuses on issues like poverty and education reform. And unlike Adelson, Gates isn’t just interested in donating money. He also wants to create change on a grassroots level by working with local communities around the world.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to giving back, Gates is in a class all his own. He may have been knocked off of his throne as America’s richest person, but when it comes to generosity and helping others, he is still number one</p>
<h1 id="Gates-Doubles-His-Salary-with-Tips-as-a-Dealer"><a href="#Gates-Doubles-His-Salary-with-Tips-as-a-Dealer" class="headerlink" title="Gates Doubles His Salary with Tips as a Dealer"></a>Gates Doubles His Salary with Tips as a Dealer</h1><p>It’s been a lucrative year for billionaire Bill Gates, with the Microsoft co-founder taking in an estimated $120 million.</p>
<p>Much of that came from his investment firm, Cascade Investment LLC, which is up more than 30% this year. But Gates also made money on the side as a blackjack dealer in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>According to reports, Gates took home $200,000 in tips during his five-day stint at the blackjack tables. That brings his total earnings for the year to $320,000 – more than double his salary as CEO of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Not bad for a part-time job.</p>
<p>Gates has a long history of gambling, and he’s said to be a skilled blackjack player. In fact, he nearly lost his fortune back in the early 1990s when he lost $7 million playing cards at the Wynn casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>But he seems to have learned his lesson, and these days is far more likely to make money than lose it playing cards. In fact, Gates has made millions from blackjack over the years; he once won $5 million from a single session at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>So how does he do it? What’s his secret?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, Gates is known for being a very tight player. He doesn’t like to risk too much money on any individual hand, which often makes him one of the shorter stacks at the table. But that also means he doesn’t mind playing multiple hands at once, which gives him more opportunities to win.</p>
<p>He’s also very disciplined when it comes to sticking to basic strategy – something that can be difficult for novice players. By playing smart and avoiding risky moves, Gates is able to minimise his losses and maximise his wins.</p>
<h1 id="Bill-Gates-is-Living-the-American-Dream-as-a-Black-Jack-Dealer"><a href="#Bill-Gates-is-Living-the-American-Dream-as-a-Black-Jack-Dealer" class="headerlink" title="Bill Gates is Living the American Dream as a Black Jack Dealer"></a>Bill Gates is Living the American Dream as a Black Jack Dealer</h1><p>The saying goes that “life is a roller coaster.” That’s certainly been the case for Bill Gates, who has gone from rags to riches and back again. Gates, who was born in 1951 in Tacoma, Washington, had a rocky upbringing. His father was a alcoholic and his mother was a stay-at-home mom.</p>
<p>In high school, Gates showed an aptitude for science and mathematics. He eventually enrolled at Harvard University, where he met Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The three of them would go on to form Microsoft, which would become the world’s largest software company.</p>
<p>Gates was a brilliant entrepreneur and businessman. But like many others, he eventually fell victim to the stock market crash of 2000. Gates ended up losing $5 billion in one day. Ouch!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Gates was able to rebound from this disaster. And today, he’s living the American dream as a black jack dealer at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. Gates says that dealing black jack is a lot of fun and allows him to meet interesting people from all over the world.</p>
<p>We asked Gates what his advice would be for young entrepreneurs who are just starting out. He said: “Never give up on your dreams. Persevere through the tough times and you’ll eventually achieve success.” We couldn’t have said it better ourselves, Bill! Thanks for being such an inspiration to us all!</p>
